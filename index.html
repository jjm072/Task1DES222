        <div class="card-blurb" id="CardBlurb4">Smart Cities have been increasing in technological developments have created technological marvels, some of these include the user of Wi-Fi, which allows the people to connect to the outside world and helps provide information and data. Places like Melbourne have inputted sensors around the city to collect data and information for the public to use such as soil moisture and parking spaces. Melbourne is also providing open data to the public which then allows the population to explore available datasets and be able to visualize and map the data to their liking. This kind of technology makes life easier for the population and gives efficiency to work and other activities. </div>

        <div class="card-blurb" id="CardBlurb5">These Smarts cities have been giving way for a number of technologies that have been put to good use in bettering city life. One of the major issues cities have encountered is the cityâ€™s connection to nature due to the heavily urbanised nature of the city. Smart cities such as Melbourne have used smart technology to increase its connection to nature and to provide a natural environment to its population. One of the ways it has done this is provide trees with email addresses which on paper sounds weird and useless but provides the population of Melbourne to report and damage to the trees that reside in the city so it can continue to maintain its natural flora.</div>

        <div class="card-blurb" id="CardBlurb6">As Cities such as Melbourne continue to grow and flourish, so will its smart technologies. Melbourne is hoping to increase its number of wide area networks and free Wi-Fi programs to better the connections throughout the city. Eventually Melbourne will become one of the first fully automated and heavily virtual cities in the world.</div>
